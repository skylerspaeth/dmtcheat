Croutonix's description:

```The goal of this project is to help people get really good score using an interactive word list for the Draw My Thing on Mineplex server. Currently, this only works on Google Chrome and Safari.

You can contribute to this project mostly by adding words to the <i>word_list.txt</i> file when you notice they are missing. Don't forget to add the words in alphabetical order and separate them using commas. If you are really experienced, you could try making it work for other browsers such as Firefox (the problem seems to be in the event not triggering on textboxes)

Last thing, you could share this with your friends and with other players on Mineplex, this way it will spread faster, more words will be discovered, making it more reliable.```
