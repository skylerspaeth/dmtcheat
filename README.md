Croutonix's description:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of this project is to help people get really good score using an interactive word list for &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Draw My Thing on Mineplex server. Currently, this only works on Google Chrome and Safari.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can contribute to this project mostly by adding words to the <i>word_list.txt</i> file when you &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;notice they are missing. Don't forget to add the words in alphabetical order and separate them using &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commas. If you are really experienced, you could try making it work for other browsers such as &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firefox (the problem seems to be in the event not triggering on textboxes)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last thing, you could share this with your friends and with other players on Mineplex, this way it &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will spread faster, more words will be discovered, making it more reliable.
